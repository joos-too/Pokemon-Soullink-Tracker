 * more visual progress. The Elite 4 + Champion fights are at the very end
 * but with equal weighting, each milestone feels the same, making the bar
 * appear "only half way" when you already reach the elite 4.
 *
 * With these weights the gym portion stretches to fill a larger share of
 * the bar while the Elite 4 + Champ and rival fights take up less space.
 * The bar still reaches exactly 100% when everything is completed,
 * regardless of how many rivals or level caps the chosen game version has.
